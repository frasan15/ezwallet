# Project Estimation - FUTURE

Version: 2


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in FUTURE version (as proposed by the team), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |             3 modules                |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |             120 lines               | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) |360 lines |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                  36                    |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 1080 euros  | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |           2 days        |

# Estimate by activity decomposition

|         Develop management documents    | 12   |    28/04/2023   | 28/04/2023    |
|         Deploy code    | 5   |    28/04/2023  | 28/04/2023    |

Note: we considered 4 people working 8 hours a day while making the diagram

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |36 person hours|1 day
| estimate by product decomposition |86 person hours|3 days
| estimate by activity decomposition |91 person hours|3 days

In the Estimated duration we considered 4 people working 8 hours a day

The difference occurs due to the different points to be considered in the approaches. While the estimation by size considers only the code, the estimation by product decomposition considers prototypes, documents and test. Finally, the estimation by activity decomposition considers all the activities involved in the project.
