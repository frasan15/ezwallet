# Defects

### Defect 1

After user logs in, he or she can choose another account to see their transactions. This is a privacy problem.

### Defect 2

The getUsers function requires to be called by a user who has Admin privileges, however this function is vital for login, where users are unathenticated and with no privileges.

### Defect 3

The getLabel function may not have the intended results, because there is not aggregation function after joining with the categories table. In this case, the results will not be summed by category, instead every transaction will have the category and color attached to its object.

### Defect 4

In the controllers/controller.js file, the create_transaction function uses an object with no date attribute to be added to the database, as it is declared in the models/model.js.
